# Digital ME

## Citizen Centricity

Digital ME is designed to be citizen centric with the social system in mind. Its primary goal is improving the self-reliance of citizens in their municipality within the Participation Act through the use of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI).

## Profile

The Digital Me profile consists of information about a citizen and their characteristics. This app is the place where they can manage information about themselves. It is about data about the citizen, such as their household composition and their CV.

The citizens themselves can decide who can view or use that data in which situation. For this we make use of SSI, Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and triple-blind authentication to ensure the citizen is protected against profiling.

## Life Events

Apart from the citizen profile, Digital ME also gives the citizen's Digital Twin senses through Life Events. These events inform citizens whenever there are changes within their life cycle that might impact their self-reliance.
